## CSAPP_Entries - Self-instruction of better following the steps of open materials.

- First, read through the materials and THE GREAT **CSAPP**. Each course's theme correspond to the chapter on book.
- There're 7 labs available for u to conquer. The process of doing them alone is not only helpful for computer basics, but also the C programming language which we will see very powerful in many ways.
- For beginners self-learning CS like me, the CMU CS Structure below may be of great help for learning routes. It's just a reference for beginners who can't follow regular college processes. However, we can follow alike structure to build our own tech stack.![Screenshot_CMU_System](/Users/zenn/Public/Github/Entries_CSAPP/statics/Screenshot_CMU_System.png)
